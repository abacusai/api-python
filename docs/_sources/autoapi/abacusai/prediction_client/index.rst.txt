The first pair represents a 'Key' where the column name (e.g. a column with name 'user_id' in the dataset) mapped to the column mapping USER_ID uniquely identifies the user against whom a prediction is made and a 'Value' which is the identifier value for that user. The second pair will have a 'Key' which will be the name of the column name (e.g. movie_name) mapped to ITEM_ID (unique item identifier) and a 'Value' which will be a list of identifiers that uniquely identifies those items.

The key, "column" takes the name of the column, "col0"; the key, "values" takes the list of items, "["value0", "value1"]" in reference to which the model recommendations need to be biased; and the key, "factor" takes the factor by which the item scores are adjusted. Let's take an example where the input to scaling_factors is [{"column": "VehicleType", "values": ["SUV", "Sedan"], "factor": 1.4}]. After we apply the model to get item probabilities, for every SUV and Sedan in the list, we will multiply the respective probability by 1.1 before sorting.

For example, if you have the column name 'user_name' mapped to the column mapping 'USER_ID', then the query must have the exact same column name (user_name) as key and the name of the user (John Doe) as value.
