      Returns a list of re-ranked items for a selected user when a list of items is required to be reranked according to the user's preferences. Note that the inputs to this method, wherever applicable, will be the column names in your dataset mapped to the column mappings in our system (e.g. column 'item_code' mapped to mapping 'ITEM_ID' in our system).

      :param deployment_token: The deployment token to authenticate access to created deployments. This token is only authorized to predict on deployments in this project, so it is safe to embed this model inside of an application or website.
      :type deployment_token: str
      :param deployment_id: The unique identifier to a deployment created under the project.
      :type deployment_id: str
      :param query_data: This will be a dictionary with two key-value pairs. The first pair represents a 'Key' where the column name (e.g. a column with name 'user_id' in your dataset) mapped to the column mapping USER_ID uniquely identifies the user against whom a prediction is made and a 'Value' which is the identifier value for that user. The second pair will have a 'Key' which will be the name of the column name (e.g. movie_name) mapped to ITEM_ID (unique item identifier) and a 'Value' which will be a list of identifiers that uniquely identifies those items.
      :type query_data: dict
      :param preserve_ranks: List of dictionaries of format {"column": "col0", "values": ["value0, value1"]}, where the ranks of items in query_data is preserved for all the items in "col0" with values, "value0" and "value1". This option is useful when the desired items are being recommended in the desired order and the ranks for those items need to be kept unchanged during recommendation generation.
      :type preserve_ranks: list
      :param preserve_unknown_items: If true, any items that are unknown to the model, will not be reranked, and the original position in the query will be preserved

      :param scaling_factors: It allows you to bias the model towards certain items. The input to this argument is a list of dictionaries where the format of each dictionary is as follows: {"column": "col0", "values": ["value0", "value1"], "factor": 1.1}. The key, "column" takes the name of the column, "col0"; the key, "values" takes the list of items, "["value0", "value1"]" in reference to which the model recommendations need to be biased; and the key, "factor" takes the factor by which the item scores are adjusted. Let's take an example where the input to scaling_factors is [{"column": "VehicleType", "values": ["SUV", "Sedan"], "factor": 1.4}]. After we apply the model to get item probabilities, for every SUV and Sedan in the list, we will multiply the respective probability by 1.1 before sorting. This is particularly useful if there is a type of item that might be less popular but you want to promote it or there is an item that always comes up and you want to demote it.

For example, if you have the column name 'user_name' mapped to the column mapping 'USER_ID', then the query must have the exact same column name (user_name) as key and the name of the user (John Doe) as value.
      :type query_data: dict

Let's take an example where the input to restrict_items is [{"column": "VehicleType", "values": ["SUV", "Sedan"]}]. This input will restrict the recommendations to SUVs and Sedans. This type of restriction is particularly useful if there's a list of items that you know is of use in some particular scenario and you want to restrict the recommendations only to that list.
      :type restrict_items: list
      :param exclude_items: It allows you to exclude certain items from the list of recommendations. The input to this argument is a list of dictionaries where the format of each dictionary is as follows: {"column": "col0", "values": ["value0", "value1", ...]}.

Let's take an example where the input to exclude_items is [{"column": "VehicleType", "values": ["SUV", "Sedan"]}]. The resulting recommendation list will exclude all SUVs and Sedans. This is particularly useful if there's a list of items that you know is of no use in some particular scenario and you don't want to show those items present in that list.
